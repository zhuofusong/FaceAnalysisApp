# Medical symptoms checker app

This app uses the saved facial landmarks statistics from the ```facial landmark detection app``` and searches for the existence of any pre-defined symptoms. If a symptom is identified, the user can choose to be redirected to the web page explaining the disease and view the distribution of the disease across regions.
