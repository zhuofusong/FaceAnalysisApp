# FaceAnalysisApp
Android/iOS app for analyzing facial characteristics based on anatomical knowledge, etc

The """android/opencamera""" folder contains a modified version of an early 2021 snapshot of the open source camera app developed by Mark Harman. The original [code repo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencamera/) has latest updates and features. The added funtionalities include

1. facial landmarks detection
2. facial landmarks analysis
   
The medical anlysis applied on the facial picture results from a simple rule-based inference using [NIH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/DDB/index.html)'s [disease database](http://www.diseasesdatabase.com/). All inferred diseases are linked with the original description on these websites.
